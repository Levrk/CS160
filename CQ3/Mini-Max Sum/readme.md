This Algorithm runs in constant time because it uses one for loop with a defined number of iterations.
If this problem did not specify the size of the array as being 5 then this problem would likely have
to be done in linear time but because it is specified we can do it in constant time.

This Algorithm has constant space complexity as we only assign three variables outside of the for loop ad one within it. Again, because the for loop runs for a set number of iterations this algorithm is constant in space complexity too.
